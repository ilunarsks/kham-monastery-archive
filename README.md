# Kham Monastery Digital Archive

## Project Purpose

This project is a collaborative digital archive dedicated to systematically documenting the history, art, architecture, and current status of significant Buddhist monasteries from the historical Kham region of Tibet. As Tibetan refugees and scholars, we aim to preserve our cultural heritage through academic research, raise awareness about preservation needs, and provide educational resources for future generations.

Our work is rooted in a commitment to cultural preservation, human rights, and justice for the Tibetan people. This archive serves as a living repository of knowledge that honors the spiritual practices, artistic achievements, and architectural wonders of Kham's monastic traditions.

## Archive Structure

The archive is organized as a version-controlled resource on GitHub, enabling collaborative contributions while maintaining a clear historical record of updates.

- **Repository Root**: Contains this README, project documentation, and high-level organizational files.
- **Monastery Entries**: Each monastery will have its own Markdown file (e.g., `dzogchen-monastery.md`) with standardized sections:
  - Historical Background
  - Architectural Style and Key Features
  - Significant Art and Spiritual Artifacts
  - Known Status Post‑1959
- **Issues**: Each monastery entry is tracked via a GitHub issue with a checklist of research tasks.
- **Releases**: Periodic releases tag stable versions of the archive, marking milestones in the project's growth.
